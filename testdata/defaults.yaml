        You just created an Ubuntu container (release=artful, arch=amd64, variant=default)

        To enable sshd, run: apt-get install openssh-server

        For security reason, container images ship without user accounts
        and without a root password.

        Use lxc-attach or chroot directly into the rootfs to set a root password
        or create user accounts.
